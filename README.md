# World-Stripper

# Info:
World Stripper is a utility mod that allows you to strip away the terrain to view the underground world generation. The mod is small and lightweight with a jar size of 50KB. By using Java 8 Lambda expressions the mod clears away terrain super fast even on slow computers. Super useful if your a pack developer and need to test world gen for your pack or you just can't seem to find the ores your looking for. Pretty much a must have tool for all map-makers, pack-makers and developers.

# Credits
I wanna give my friend Moze_intel a huge shout out for creating the original strippermod_4.20.
