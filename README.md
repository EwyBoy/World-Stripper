## Info:
World Stripper is a utility mod that allows you to strip away the terrain to view the underground world generation. The mod is small and lightweight and made with performance in mind. The mod clears away terrain super fast even on slow computers. Super useful if your a pack developer and need to test world gen for your pack or you just can't seem to find the ores your looking for. Pretty much a must have tool for all map-makers, pack-makers and developers.
