# World-Stripper

# Info:
World Stripper is a utility mod that allows you to strip away the terrain to view the underground world generation. The mod is small and lightweight with a jar size of 50KB. Super useful if you are a pack developer and need to test world gen for your pack or you just can't seem to find the ores your looking for. Pretty much a must have tool for all map-makers, pack-makers and developers.

# Developers
To add World Stripper to your development environment you need to add the following codeblocks to your projects `build.gralde` file.  

You also need to generate a github token and add it along with your github username to your personal `gradle.properties` file in `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\.gradle` or `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`.
This file may not exist, and you would have to create it yourself.

Github tokens can be generated by clicking **_[here](https://github.com/settings/tokens)_**!  

Click **_Generate New Token_** and click the checkmark : **_read:packages_**.

Example of `gradle.properties` file in `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\.gradle` or `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`
```groovy
//Your Github username 
gpr.username=ewyboy

//Your Github generated token with read permission checked off
gpr.token=7aa18973a4d2702de0ee6ac5e9584b03333f33a0
```
-----------------------------------
Code to add to `build.gradle`
```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        name = "WorldStripper"
        url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/ewyboy/world-stripper")
        credentials {
            username = property('gpr.username')
            password = property('gpr.token')
        }
    }
}

```
```groovy
dependencies {
    // Replace VERSION_NUMBER with the version of World-Stripper you want
    // Example: implementation "com.ewyboy.worldstripper:World-Stripper:1.16.3-1.7.2"
    // Builds can be found here: https://github.com/EwyBoy/World-Stripper/packages
    implementation "com.ewyboy.worldstripper:World-Stripper:VERSION_NUMBER"
}
```
